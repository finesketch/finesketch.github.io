<p>Calligraphy, literally “beautiful writing,” has been appreciated as an art form in many different cultures throughout the world, but the stature of calligraphy in Chinese culture is unmatched.</p>
<h2 id="武---the-character-of-warrior">武 - The Character of Warrior</h2>
<p>Today we will take a look at the character of <strong>武</strong>. It means warrior, military, chivalry, arms, or referring to someone who practices martial art. This character is used in Chinese and Japanese, and they share the same meaning.</p>

<p>To practice, remember the basic of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should always start from <em>top</em> to <em>bottom</em> and then <em>left</em> to <em>right</em></li>
<li>Focus on the <em>balance</em> of the character and the composition of the <em>whole</em></li>
<li>Last of all, remember to relax and stay focus on the character you try to write</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>First of all, review the size of the paper you plan to write on. So you should start from <em>top-left</em> of the paper. The stroke always starts from <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>. It should be shorter of <strong>一</strong> character.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-1.png" alt="step-1" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>
<p>The second stroke should be much longer of <strong>一</strong>, and as always you should write it from <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>. This <strong>一</strong> character should take up almost the full length of width.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-2.png" alt="step 2" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4>
<p>The next is the vertical line connecting from the second stroke you just wrote. Just a short vertical line almost under the first stroke if you try to figure out where to start.</p>

<h4 id="step-4">Step 4</h4>
<p>The fourth stroke connects from the third stroke about half of distance to the <em>right</em>. It is a short character of <strong>一</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-4.png" alt="step 4" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="step-5">Step 5</h4>
<p>Another vertical stroke to the <em>left</em> of above vertical line. This vertical line should be shorter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-5.png" alt="step 5" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="step-6">Step 6</h4>
<p>The next stroke is an interesting one, it is not quite like <strong>一</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-6.png" alt="step 6" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="step-7">Step 7</h4>
<p>The next stroke is the most important one, this stroke brings everything together and it should form the composition of the artwork. This stroke starts all the way from the <em>top</em>, and then you drags the brush all the way to the <em>bottom-right</em>. Finally, you end it by moving upward. This character symbolizes power, strength, and sword.</p>

<h4 id="step-8">Step 8</h4>
<p>Finally you end it by write a <em>dot</em> to the <em>top-right</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesketch.com/resources/warrior-8.png" alt="step 8" width="450" height="600"></p>
<h4 id="complete">Complete</h4>
<p>I was given the <em>time</em> and <em>space</em> to create this artwork. I completed it with my two stamps.</p>

<p>This is one of those projects I have to complete. The drawing took place when I was visiting Kyoto, Japan. Spending approximately 6 hours in total to complete. The drawing was done in <strong>procreate</strong>, the iPad version of iOS app. The hardware I used is Apple iPad Pro accompanied by the amazing Apple Pencil. After the drawing was finished, I exported it out as a HD video and then edited it in iMovie. Oh yes music, I borrowed it from the movie soundtrack Furious 7, “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa featured Charlie Puth (No shakuhachi for now, maybe some other drawings).</p>

<p>Again this drawing was created entirely in <strong>procreate</strong> iPad app. I particularly like the 6B Pencil brush. It gives me the control I love like how I feel it on the drawing paper. Enjoy.</p>

<p>The picture of Mother Teresa was taken while she was reading a book. The drawing was done using Apple iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. It is amazing to be able to play the Japanese bamboo flute shakuhachi. The background music I recorded is Amazing Grace on shakuhachi <em>1.8</em>.</p>
